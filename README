required:
v8 javascript engine ( http://code.google.com/p/v8/ ) ** shipped
libev IO layer ( http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html ) ** shipped
fastcgi libraries ( http://www.fastcgi.com/ ) -> either /usr/include or /usr/local/include
mysql libraries ( http://www.mysql.com ) -> MAKE SURE mysql_config is in your path

just run:
cd src && make



The tracker has 2 entry points:
** announce/scrape default: port 8080
the tracker itself

** fastcgi default: port 8082
tracker status and torrent status using json
considering that you mapped /lbtt as fastcgi endpoint, the status urls are:
http://localhost/lbtt/status -> tracker info, example:
{ "torrents": 46,"peers": 2457,"seeders": 27,"downloads": 15 }
and can also be called with a callback ( to be included in webpages and stuff )

http://localhost/lbtt/status?callback -> cb = callback, example:
callback({ "torrents": 46,"peers": 2458,"seeders": 28,"downloads": 15 })

the torrentinfo url requires a infohash parameter just like announce/scrape
http://localhost/lbtt/info?info_hash=%e6%1bp%9bR%7b%dc%2f%a4%04%c7%8f%3cZ%d8%27%c72%7d%91
and the output:
{ "complete": 0,"downloaded": 0,"incomplete": 1 }

a callback can also be passed as
http://localhost/lbtt/info?info_hash=%e6%1bp%9bR%7b%dc%2f%a4%04%c7%8f%3cZ%d8%27%c72%7d%91&cb=callback
callback({ "complete": 0,"downloaded": 0,"incomplete": 1 })
