required:
v8 javascript engine ( http://code.google.com/p/v8/ ) ** shipped
libev IO layer ( http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html ) ** shipped
fastcgi libraries ( http://www.fastcgi.com/ )
boost libraries ( http://www.boost.org/ )
mysql libraries ( http://www.mysql.com )

compiling is still kinda a pain, just make sure you put all required libs in the required directories and you'll be fine.
